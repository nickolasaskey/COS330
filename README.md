How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This course has helped me to understand and gain the ability to utilize OpenGL and it's subsequent additions.  This course has also helped with my 'eye for design'; it has helped me gain a better
understanding of how different aspects of virtual environments will affect the outcome of the design.  Ultimately, the testing phase of the design process was the most useful in completing my vision for the course. 
While each element of the process is essential to the entire cycle, the testing phase was utilized after each and every change while coding to ensure that everything was functioning properly.

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

There were several development strategies that played an integral role in the creation of my 3D scene, but understanding and implementing all of the requirements set forth by the client is what helped push me in the right direction during development.  It is important to take what is requested and ensure that every aspect is not only fulfilled, but the expectations should be exceeded.  Iteration played a big role in this as well, as it encapsulated all of the testing and debugging that occurred during the programming stage.  Throughout the milestones, I gained a better understanding of how OpenGL operates, and more importantly, what functions and methods exist to help guide the user.  Some parts of the project were confusing and difficult, but after some research, each problem could be solved by some function that already existed in the OpenGL library.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

My ultimate goal is to become a game designer, and learning about how this type of API operates and how to use it properly will help me make great strides in my future aspirations.  While most game development softwares do a lot of this work for you; namely Unity and Unreal Engine which already incorporate one API or another to do all of the rendering for you, actually learning about how they work really helps to understand how to better utilize them to create and produce different games.
